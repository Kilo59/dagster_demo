# Dagster vs Airflow dependencies

The Airflow UI, schedular, and python library for defining DAGs are all tightly coupled in a single
`apache-airflow` python package.

In contrast Dagster is split into two separate python packages `dagster` the core package & `dagit` the UI.

**NOTE: Dependencies all resolved on Windows**
